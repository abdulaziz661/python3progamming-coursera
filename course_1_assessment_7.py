#rainfall_mi is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every month separated by a comma. Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. Store the result in the variable num_rainy_months. In other words, count the number of items with values > 3.0.
